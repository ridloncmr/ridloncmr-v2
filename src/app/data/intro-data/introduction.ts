ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Christian!

Iâ€™m an Application Architect who thrives on breaking down complexity, optimizing systems, and delivering clean, scalable solutions. Iâ€™ve worked on everything from high-uptime enterprise platforms to AI-driven applications, and I love the mix of deep technical challenges and big-picture thinking.

I like writing about architecture, product design, and the realities of building softwareâ€”along with a good spooky story. Whether itâ€™s tech, sports, or why planning poker always turns into a disaster, Iâ€™m always up for a good conversation. Letâ€™s connect.
