I woke up to the sound of something scraping against metal.

I shot up, gasping for air. My head spun, but the vertigo wasn’t from the usual waking up—no, this was something wrong. Something off.

I was lying on cold concrete. It wasn’t my bed. It wasn’t even a room. I looked around—vines crawling through cracked windows, rusted cars stacked like they’d been there for decades. The city was a shell. A graveyard.

The air was sickeningly stale, like it hadn’t been touched by wind in years. There was a metallic smell, sharp and nauseating.

I stood, trying to steady myself, but my legs felt weak. I reached for my wrist. My comm band—the one the NWO gave me—wasn’t just dead. It was glitching. The screen flickered, blinking out and back on with a strange static, as if the tech was trying to fight for life.

This wasn’t right. I was supposed to be in New Chicago, with my wife and kid, in the New World—a place free of suffering, free of the chaos that had eaten up Earth. How the hell did I get here?

I scanned the streets—empty. Not a soul in sight. Not a breath of life.

And then—I saw something. A shadow.

It darted behind an old car, quick and silent. I barely caught a glimpse. Was it… human? Or was I just seeing things?

A chill slithered down my spine. I was not alone.

I forced myself to breathe, to think clearly. Panic wasn’t going to help.

Where was I? Why was I here?

I checked my pockets—nothing. I wasn’t armed, not that I could remember how I’d even ended up like this. The comm band was dead, my tech useless.

I tried rebooting it, tapping on the screen repeatedly, but the message was the same: Corrupted data.

I stumbled forward, unsure of where to go. My mind kept looping back to my family—where were they? Were they here too? Did they glitch out just like me?

The streets stretched out before me, looking like something out of a post-apocalyptic nightmare. Old shops, broken windows, shattered glass—remnants of a world that had been forgotten. Graffiti smeared across the walls in eerie, jarring messages:

“THEY PULLED US BACK.”
“WE NEVER LEFT.”
“DON’T TRUST THE PORTAL.”

It didn’t take long before the first bodies appeared.

A pile of rotting clothing. A rusted metal pipe beside it. Empty eyes staring from a face that was no longer human, the skin withered and decayed, skin melted into the concrete.

I backed away quickly, my heartbeat pounding in my ears. This wasn’t natural. This wasn’t just old-world decay. This was wrong.

I felt the air shift—an icy breeze passing through the streets like a breath from a forgotten tomb.

I didn’t know where to go, but I had to find someone, anyone.

As I rounded a corner, I saw a figure standing motionless in the middle of the street. It wasn’t a person—not anymore.

It was a corpse, partially mummified, covered in dust and dirt but unmistakably alive in some twisted way. Its eyes were wide open, a glazed stare fixed on me.

I froze. This wasn’t just an abandoned body. This thing had been alive—a person like me, before they glitched back.

Its mouth moved.

“I’m still here,” it whispered hoarsely. “I’m still here.”

I stumbled backward, nearly tripping over the wreck of a destroyed car. Its fingers twitched, and the body shuddered like it was waking from a nightmare.

I didn’t wait to see what it would do next. I turned and ran.

But there were more.

Figures piled together in the shadows, silent and staring. Some seemed frozen in place; others moved slowly, like they were still trying to understand what happened. Some were glitching, their bodies distorting, shifting, as though they weren’t meant to exist in this world.

Their whispers filled the air: “I’m still here.” “I shouldn’t be.” “I don’t remember how I got here.”

Suddenly, I felt the unmistakable pressure of eyes on me—everywhere. I was being watched.

I ran until I couldn’t run anymore. I stumbled into an old NWO research station, its walls caved in, the door half-broken. Inside, the air was thick with the stench of mildew and rot. But there was a power source, flickering weakly.

On a table, I found a terminal, its screen covered in grime. I approached cautiously, my fingers trembling as I wiped it off, revealing the cracked screen. I hit a button.

A message began to play, garbled and glitching.

“If you’re hearing this… we failed. The portal… never stable… not safe…”
“It’s not random. The glitches. They’re… pulling us back.”
“We—trapped. He won’t let us leave. He—”

The message cut off. The screen flickered again, distorting, lines of unreadable text flashing for a split second before the entire terminal went black.

Silence.

I took a breath. Too soon.

The terminal snapped back to life.

The screen filled with static, like something was fighting to break through. My gut twisted, every muscle in my body screaming at me to back away—

Then, a phrase burned into the screen, the letters sharp, glowing in that sickly green of old-world terminals:

“YOU WERE NEVER MEANT TO BE THERE.”

My pulse stopped.

The screen cracked. A sharp pop rang through the room, and the entire system died instantly, like something had forcefully severed it from existence.

I stumbled back, my hands shaking.

The words wouldn’t leave my head.

I had spent my entire life in the New World. I was born there. I was supposed to be there.

But something—someone—was telling me that was a lie.

And worse…

They pulled me back on purpose.

The message was burned into my brain. You were never meant to be there.

The wind outside had changed. It wasn’t just air moving anymore—it carried something else. A pressure, a static charge that made my teeth buzz, like the world itself was unraveling.

I turned toward the doorway.

The storm had arrived.

Glitch-light rippled through the sky, a sickly blue tearing across the clouds, casting long, jagged shadows over the ruins. The ground trembled as something cracked through reality itself—like a seam splitting open, something forcing its way through.

My whole body screamed at me to run. To find shelter.

To find a way back.

But…

I hesitated.

I could try to escape. Maybe the NWO would take me back. Maybe they’d wipe my memory, erase this like a bad dream, and I’d wake up in my bed, safe in the New World.

But I knew—I knew too much now.

They wouldn’t take me back.

Not the same way.

The air rippled—a low, distorted hum rising from the depths of the ruined city. I saw shapes moving, far off in the distance. Glitching figures, flickering in and out of existence. Some walking. Some crawling. Some staring.

And one of them… looked like me.

It wasn’t just a resemblance. It was me. Same face. Same posture. Even the same confused, terrified look in its glitching, half-lit eyes.

It opened its mouth—and my voice came out.

“I’m still here.”

My stomach twisted into knots. My body screamed at me to run. But I didn’t.

Because deep down, I already knew the truth.

The New World didn’t take us completely.
It left something behind.

The storm grew stronger, flickering blue tendrils of glitch-light snaking across the ruined buildings.

I took a breath—deep, steady. My fingers clenched into a fist.

Then, I stepped away from the terminal.

I wasn’t running anymore.

I wasn’t going back.

The storm was closing in, and I was part of the glitch now.
