The last thing I remember is falling.

A sudden, gut-wrenching drop. The kind that doesn’t just make your stomach lurch, it pulls something deeper, something essential out of you. My vision blurred, my breath hitched… and then, nothing.

Not darkness. Not light. Just absence.

Then, I woke up.

At first, I thought I was home. The air smelled right, faint traces of coffee and fabric softener, my wife’s favorite candle still lingering in the living room. The hum of the television droned softly in the background. The details were perfect, but something was wrong.

I reached for the doorknob, but my hand passed straight through it.

A deep, primal dread clawed at my stomach. I turned, desperate to ground myself—to prove I was still here—but every attempt to touch, to move, to exist failed.

And then, I saw them.

In the living room, my wife sat curled up on the couch, scrolling through her phone. My daughter, nestled against her side, giggled at something on the TV. The dog lay at their feet, his tail thumping lazily against the rug.

I was home. But I wasn’t there.

"Hey!" I called out. "I'm right here!"

Nothing. No flinch, no reaction. The words died in the air, swallowed by the hum of normalcy. I tried again, louder.

Still nothing.

Then, he stepped into the room.

A man wearing my clothes, with my posture, my voice… stretching his arms as he walked in, yawning like he’d just woken up from the best sleep of his life.

But his face…

It was mine. And yet, it wasn’t.

His features were identical, down to the faint scar above my left eyebrow, the way one side of my mouth curled slightly higher when I smiled. But something about it was off. Too smooth, too deliberate. A mask that fit almost perfectly, but not quite.

His smile was wide. Too wide.

His eyes held no warmth. No familiarity. Only something hollow. Hungry.

My wife glanced up and smiled at him. At him.

“Morning, babe.”

My daughter’s face lit up.

“Daddy!” she chirped, launching herself into his arms.

I staggered back.

This wasn’t real. This wasn’t happening. This was impossible.

The man moved exactly like me. But his movements felt... rehearsed. Like an actor who had studied every micro-expression, every nuance, but couldn't quite feel them.

I screamed, a raw, desperate sound that no one heard. No one except him.

For the briefest second, he paused.

And then, he turned directly toward me.

And he smiled.

***

I told myself I was dreaming. A coma. A hallucination. A dying brain flicker.

But then the changes started.

My old photos—the ones of me at my wedding, at my daughter’s birth—had his face now.

Not just in recent photos. All of them.

My baby pictures. My high school graduation. My childhood yearbook? His name under my picture.

It wasn’t just that he had taken my place. It was that I had never existed.

Or… had I?

The thought hit me like ice water, spreading deep into my bones. What did I look like?

I tried to picture my own face, tried to conjure up some solid, indisputable memory of myself.

But every time I did, the image blurred.

Like a reflection in moving water, distorting the moment I tried to focus.

Had my eyes always been that color? Was my nose just slightly different? Were my teeth ever that white? My smile… had it always been… off?

I clenched my fists. My fingers twitched, but even the sensation of my own hands felt distant. Like I was slipping away.

Maybe this wasn’t possession. Maybe this wasn’t some entity stealing my life.

Maybe I was just… forgetting myself.

I needed to hold onto something, anything, to prove I had been real. But the memories were unraveling, thinning out like mist before the morning sun.

And then, I realized…

The dog knew.

He wouldn’t go near him. He would sit at the edge of the room, staring, trembling, a low whimper escaping his throat whenever the imposter came close.

The first time it happened, my wife frowned. “What’s gotten into him?” she asked.

The imposter just smiled.

“He’ll come around.”

The next morning, the dog was gone.

***

It didn’t stop there.

My wife’s laughter turned strange, stilted, hollow, like it wasn’t quite hers anymore. My daughter’s bright eyes dimmed, as if something inside her was fading, slipping away.

Then, he started looking for me.

It began as small glances. A tilt of the head, like he was listening to something faint.

Then, the notes started appearing.

I know you’re here.

Scrawled in the condensation of the bathroom mirror.

Does it hurt?

Carved into my old desk.

You should have stayed dead.

And then, one night, I watched as my wife fell asleep beside him, unaware, unbothered, oblivious.

He sat up slowly, turned toward my usual spot on the floor where I sat every night, watching.

And in a voice that was mine but not mine, he whispered:

"I see you."

I tried to run, but there was nowhere to go. Nowhere he wouldn’t find me.

Then came the final horror.

My daughter, barely awake, rubbing her tired eyes, murmured in that soft, innocent voice… 

"Daddy… why do you keep smiling like that?"

He didn’t answer.

He just looked straight at me.

And as I watched, his face seemed to settle, smoothing into something too perfect. Unchanging.

And I realized, in that moment, I couldn't remember if I had ever smiled like that, too.
