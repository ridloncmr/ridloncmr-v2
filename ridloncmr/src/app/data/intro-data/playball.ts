ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Christian!

Iâ€™m an Application Architect who thrives on breaking down complexity, optimizing systems, and delivering clean, scalable solutions. Iâ€™ve worked on everything from high-uptime enterprise platforms to AI-driven applications, and I love the mix of deep technical challenges and big-picture thinking.

Right now, Iâ€™m also launching PlayBall.gg, a modern rec league manager built with zero friction in mind. No sign-ups, no clunky apps. Just a simple, shareable invite link that gets players in the game instantly. Itâ€™s a 60-day SaaS challenge, but more than that, itâ€™s my way of leveling up on the business side of software.

I like writing about architecture, product design, and the realities of building softwareâ€”along with a good spooky story. Whether itâ€™s tech, sports, or why planning poker always turns into a disaster, Iâ€™m always up for a good conversation. Letâ€™s connect.
