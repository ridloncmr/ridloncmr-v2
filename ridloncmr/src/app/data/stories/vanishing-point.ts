The first time Vera noticed something was wrong, her son was staring out the window.

It was past midnight. She should’ve been asleep, but the bed felt too big, too cold without Jared beside her.

She found her son in the dark, standing on tiptoe to see the city outside. The glow of neon lights painted his small face in soft pinks and blues.

“Baby, what are you doing?” she asked, rubbing the exhaustion from her face.

He didn’t turn right away. When he finally did, his face was pale, his eyes wide with something too heavy for a child to carry.

“Mom,” he whispered. “The city’s broken.”

Vera’s stomach clenched. She stepped forward, following his gaze.

Outside, the city was perfect—towering glass buildings, warm artificial streetlights, the quiet hum of a world that had left suffering behind.

But her son still looked scared.

“You don’t see it?”

She knelt beside him, brushing his dark curls from his forehead. He was warm, no fever. But his hands trembled where they gripped the windowsill.

“See what, sweetheart?” she asked gently.

He swallowed hard, staring back at the skyline.

“The buildings… they keep changing.”

Her breath caught.

“They’re normal now,” he continued. “But sometimes… sometimes they go dark. Like they’ve been dead for years. And I see people walking, but they don’t look right. They flicker, like a bad video.”

A chill ran down Vera’s spine.

“Like a glitch?” she whispered.

Her son nodded, his little fingers curling into her sleeve.

Vera forced herself to smile. “It’s just a bad dream,” she said, even though she wasn’t sure who she was trying to convince.

But then he said something that made her blood run cold.

“Daddy’s out there.”

At first, Vera tried to ignore it.

Grief did strange things to the mind. The mind searched for patterns, for ways to fill the empty space where someone had been.

But then the stories started.

The news said glitching incidents weren’t increasing. But people whispered otherwise. They whispered about vanished loved ones, missing co-workers, empty homes where families used to live.

And all the while, her son kept seeing things.

One morning, he refused to go to school. He sat at the table, arms wrapped around himself, eyes fixed on the floor.

“Talk to me,” Vera pleaded, crouching beside him.

He shook his head.

She tried again. “Is something wrong at school?”

Another pause. Then, in a small voice:

“My teacher disappeared.”

Vera frowned. “What do you mean?”

“I mean she’s gone,” he whispered. “I told people, but no one remembers her. Her whole class just… doesn’t remember.”

Vera’s pulse pounded in her ears.

That night, after her son fell asleep, she searched the school database.

No record of the teacher existed.

Her hands trembled. She was about to turn off the screen when she caught a glimpse of herself in the dark reflection.

For just a second—just a breath—her face flickered.

She didn’t sleep.


The call came the next morning.

“Mrs. Hollis?” a warm voice greeted. “This is just a routine checkup for your son. We’d like to conduct a small cognitive evaluation. Nothing to worry about.”

The words sent a bolt of panic through her.

She hadn’t scheduled anything.

Her grip on the receiver tightened. “I’m sorry—who referred you?”

The voice remained smooth, calm.

“We noticed some flagged behavior patterns. It’s standard protocol for children experiencing prolonged grief.”

Her heartbeat thundered in her chest.

They knew.

They knew about him.

That night, Vera packed a bag.

She didn’t know where they would go—only that they couldn’t stay.

She picked her son up from school, trying to act normal, trying to stay calm. But the moment they stepped outside, two NWO agents were waiting.

They were dressed in polite gray suits, their smiles soft, reassuring.

“Mrs. Hollis,” one said warmly. “Could we have a moment?”

Her hands clenched around her son’s.

The agents asked simple questions—too simple. They studied her son’s face with too much interest.

“Have you been seeing things, sweetheart?”

Her son stayed silent.

Vera took a step back, ready to leave.

That’s when one of the agents asked, very casually:

“Mrs. Hollis, do you remember when you scheduled this meeting with us?”

She stopped.

Her mouth went dry.

Because she didn’t.

She never scheduled it.

They were already watching.

She yanked her son away and fled.

The car sped down the empty freeway, heading toward the city’s edge.

Her son sat silently beside her, gripping his seatbelt.

She reached over, squeezing his hand. “It’s gonna be okay, baby.”

But he didn’t answer.

She glanced at him—and her stomach twisted.

His eyes were wide, unblinking. His gaze was fixed on the night sky.

“It’s happening again,” he whispered.

Vera followed his gaze.

Her breath hitched.

The stars flickered.

A low hum filled the air, rattling through the dashboard. The numbers on the speedometer glitched—40, 150, 3, 88.

The road ahead rippled.

Her grip tightened on the wheel.

Then—a sharp static pop.

The entire car jerked.

Her son gasped—his body distorted, flickered.

“Baby, hold on to me,” she begged, reaching for him.

He turned to her, eyes wide with terror.

“Mom, don’t let go of my hand.”

“I won’t,” she swore.

But the moment she blinked—he was gone.

The car screeched to a stop.

Vera threw the door open, stumbling onto the pavement.

The seat beside her was empty.

Her son was gone.

Her breath came in short, panicked gasps.

She spun in circles, searching the road, the trees, the empty city skyline—nothing.

The only thing left was his backpack, resting on the seat like he’d never been there at all.

She reached for it, hands shaking.

A whisper crackled through the radio.

“Mom?”

Her head snapped up.

The city shifted.

For just a second, the New World fell away—and the ruins of the Old World bled through.

A flash of a boy, standing in the static.

Her son.

But he wasn’t alone.

The shadows of others surrounded him, flickering in and out of existence.

She reached toward him. “Baby—”

The world snapped back.

Everything was normal again.

The city stood tall. The street was empty.

And Vera Hollis was alone.
