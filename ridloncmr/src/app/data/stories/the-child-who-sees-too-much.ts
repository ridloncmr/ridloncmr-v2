The first time Vera noticed something was wrong, her son stood by the window, staring.

It was past midnight. She should have been asleep, but the bed felt too big, too cold without Jared beside her. The hush of the apartment pressed in, thick with something unseen. A static tension, like the air before a storm.

Padding down the hallway, she found her son on tiptoe, pressed against the glass. Neon light from the city below bathed his face in soft pinks and blues. He didn’t move. Didn’t blink.

"Baby, what are you doing?" she asked, rubbing exhaustion from her eyes.

For a moment, he stayed still, as if he hadn’t heard. When he finally turned, his face was pale, eyes distant, like he was seeing something she couldn’t.

"Mom," he whispered. "The city’s broken."

A cold prickle crept up her spine. She followed his gaze.

Outside, the skyline gleamed—towering glass buildings, the hum of electric traffic, a world that had left suffering behind. But his little fingers gripped the windowsill hard enough to turn his knuckles white.

"You don’t see it?"

Vera knelt beside him, smoothing a hand over his dark curls. No fever. No sign of distress, except for the way his breath hitched.

"See what, sweetheart?"

He swallowed. "The buildings… they keep changing."

Her pulse stuttered.

"They're normal now, but sometimes… sometimes they go dark. Like they've been abandoned for years. And the people..." He hesitated, his small body tensing. "They glitch. Like they’re trapped between places."

A sharp chill threaded through her chest.

"Like a bad signal?" she whispered.

He nodded, fingers curling into the fabric of her sleeve.

Vera forced a smile. "It’s just a bad dream," she murmured.

But then he said something that made her blood run cold.

"Daddy’s out there."

Even as she carried him back to bed, the city hummed beyond the window—steady, unchanging. But Vera couldn't shake the feeling that something had already shifted beneath its perfect facade.

At first, Vera told herself it was grief.

Grief twisted the mind, turned shadows into ghosts. It made you see things that weren’t there. But the stories started.

The news insisted glitching incidents weren’t increasing, but people whispered otherwise. Entire families vanishing overnight. Co-workers who no longer existed. Apartment complexes wiped clean of tenants, as if they had never been occupied.

And her son kept seeing things.

One morning, he refused to go to school. He sat stiff at the table, arms wrapped around himself, his cereal untouched.

"Talk to me," Vera pleaded, crouching beside him.

He shook his head.

"Is something wrong at school?"

A pause. Then, in a small voice:

"My teacher disappeared."

A slow, creeping dread curled in her stomach.

"What do you mean, sweetheart?"

"She’s gone," he whispered. "I told people, but no one remembers her. Her whole class doesn’t remember."

That night, after he was asleep, Vera searched the school’s database.

No record of the teacher existed.

Her fingers clenched against the desk. The screen flickered, her reflection shimmering like oil on water. For a single breath, her own face... distorted.

The glitch rippled through her.

She didn’t sleep.

The call came the next morning.

"Mrs. Hollis? This is a routine check-up for your son. We’d like to conduct a small cognitive evaluation. Nothing to worry about."

Panic flared sharp and sudden.

She hadn’t scheduled anything.

Her grip on the receiver tightened. "Who referred you?"

A pause. Then, a smooth, practiced voice. "We noticed some flagged behavior patterns. Standard protocol for children experiencing prolonged grief."

They knew.

That night, Vera packed a bag.

She didn’t have a plan—just an overwhelming certainty that they couldn’t stay.

When she picked her son up from school, she forced herself to smile. "We’re going on a little trip."

He nodded, trusting. But the moment they stepped outside, two figures in gray suits were waiting.

Soft, reassuring smiles.

"Mrs. Hollis," one greeted. "Could we have a moment?"

She gripped her son’s hand tighter.

The agents asked gentle, meaningless questions. Their attention lingered too long on her son.

"Have you been seeing things, sweetheart?"

Her son stayed silent.

A single step back.

Then, casually, one of them asked, "Mrs. Hollis, do you remember scheduling this meeting with us?"

Her breath hitched.

Because she didn’t.

One of the agents smiled—too smooth, too knowing. "We only want to make sure everything stays in order. It’s our duty to ensure everyone is accounted for." A slight pause. "And, of course, to prevent unnecessary… confusion."

Vera felt her pulse hammer against her throat. "We’re in a hurry."

The other agent tilted his head, as if considering her words. "Of course. That makes sense. Though, you’d be surprised how often people misremember things." His smile didn’t reach his eyes. "Sometimes, they forget whole people."

Her grip on her son’s hand tightened. He squeezed back.

She yanked him forward and ran.

The car hurtled down the freeway.

City lights shrank in the rearview mirror. Her son sat stiff beside her, fingers twisted in his seatbelt.

Her mind raced. Was she making a mistake? Was this paranoia, or was she finally seeing the world for what it was? The weight of uncertainty crushed her chest, but her hands stayed firm on the wheel.

"It’s gonna be okay, baby," she whispered, reaching over to squeeze his arm.

He didn’t answer. His gaze locked on the sky.

"It’s happening again," he murmured.

Vera followed his stare.

The stars pulsed—erratic, like failing circuitry.

A low hum vibrated through the dashboard. The speedometer numbers scrambled—40, 3, 88. The road ahead rippled, twisting like a submerged reflection in shattered glass.

A sharp pop!

The car jerked.

Her son gasped—his body wavered, split-second echoes of him flickering like overlapping images.

"Baby, hold on to me!"

Terror filled his eyes.

"Mom, don’t let go."

"I won’t. I swear I won’t." Her voice cracked, desperation clawing at her throat.

But then—

The world blinked.

And he was gone.

Vera’s scream shattered the silence.

The car screeched to a stop.

She threw open the door, stumbling onto the pavement, her breath ragged.

"No, no, no—this isn’t real." Her voice broke as she turned in circles, searching, pleading for something, anything, to tell her this was just another glitch, something she could undo.

The seat beside her was empty.

Her son was gone.

Spinning, she searched the road, the trees, the empty expanse around her.

Nothing.

The only thing left was his backpack, resting on the seat like he had never been there at all.

Her fingers trembled as she reached for it.

The radio crackled.

A whisper.

"Mom?"

Her head snapped up.

The city fractured.

For a single, gut-wrenching second, the New World peeled back—revealing the ruins beneath, a crumbling past swallowed by time.

A boy stood in the static.

Her son.

He wasn’t alone.

Shadows surrounded him, figures flickering in and out of existence, their edges jagged with distortion.

Vera lurched forward. "Baby—"

The world snapped back.

Neon lights. Towering buildings. Normal.

The road was empty.

Every glitch, every vanished soul, was a fragment of a world unraveling… one that she now faced alone
