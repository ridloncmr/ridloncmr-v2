Ellie was always a fighter. She raised two children, survived the war, and still made the best damn Thanksgiving stuffing this side of the Mississippi. She refused to be fragile, refused to slow down, refused to be anything other than the unshakable heart of her family.

<i>But the Hunger came for her.</i>

At first, the doctor called it Parkinson’s—a careful, clinical word that sat cold in her throat. He spoke of dopamine loss, nerve degeneration, muscle rigidity—as if her body was simply a machine breaking down, as if she were just parts failing, wires fraying. But Ellie knew better.

It wasn’t mechanical failure. It was something inside her, taking its time. Something old and hungry.

It didn’t crave her flesh. It craved her… her memories, her strength, her certainty. It gnawed, just a little more each day. Never satisfied. Never full.

Ellie fought. She whispered her grandbabies’ names every morning, like prayers against the dark. She stitched until her fingers bled, daring the Hunger to take her hands. When her legs faltered, she gripped the counter and willed herself to stand.

But this was not a battle.

This was a feeding.

<i>And it would not stop.</i>

Ellie began to see it everywhere.

In the bright-eyed actor she once loved, now stiff as though something had taken hold. In the distant, fogged-over gaze of the champion, once quick as lightning, now slow as the tide.

She saw it in the doctor’s hesitation, his mouth tightening before he spoke. He didn’t have a cure. Only strategies. Only delays.

That was how the Hunger worked. Not all at once. But slow, patient, insatiable.

It was in the missed steps, the lost names, the forgotten faces. In the way people slowly unraveled, piece by piece, until they were hollowed out and left behind as shadows of themselves.

Ellie would not be one of them.

<i>She refused.</i>

The night it took her name, she woke up gasping. She reached for the word, but it was already gone, already eaten. The Hunger coiled through her bones, patient, waiting.

She clenched her fists, nails pressing into her palms. The tremor was worse now… her fingers no longer wholly her own. It was stealing more than her strength.

"You will not erase me," she whispered.

The Hunger only pressed closer.

But she was still here.

She was Ellie, who survived the war. Ellie, who raised two strong children. Ellie, who made the best damn stuffing this side of the Mississippi.

And she was still here—grinding the bread into crumbs, but now with her great-grandkids.

The Hunger might take her, but she would not go quietly. It hadn’t won yet.

Her children would remember.

Her grandchildren would tell her stories.

Her great-grandchildren would grind the bread.

<i>Parkinson’s could feast, but it would never be full.</i>
