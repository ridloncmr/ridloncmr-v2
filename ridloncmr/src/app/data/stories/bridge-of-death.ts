Snow drifted lazily through the air, soft and weightless, catching the glow of the streetlights. A handful of children chased each other along the bridge, their laughter ringing out over the silent city. A young couple stood near the railing, their breath misting in the cool April air. The husband had his arms wrapped around his wife’s belly, their unborn child nestled between them.

“We’re lucky,” he murmured against her ear.

She smiled, resting a hand over his. “We are.”

From here, the skyline stretched before them, the heart of Pripyat glowing against the night. But all eyes were on the plant. Reactor 4 was burning.

The fire shimmered in the distance, eerie and unnatural. Some whispered about an explosion. Others reassured one another: it was nothing, just a fire. The workers had it under control. The air smelled sharp, metallic.

Ash clung to their coats, settled in their hair.

The husband kissed his wife’s temple. “Let’s go home.”

A child sneezed, wiping soot from his nose. Another laughed, catching flakes on her tongue.

It was not snow.

It never was.
